This is one of the first songs that I fully developed in Ableton, where I now primarily do all my music creation.

The weird inspiration behind this was essentially about a space dog named Skiddy who explored the galaxy. So uuuuh, yeah.

Check this song out on [bandcamp](https://bang-tilde.bandcamp.com/track/skiddy) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/bang-tilde/skiddy)!
